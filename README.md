# Fixed Effects and Random Effects Modeling

This workshop offers an accessible introduction to longitudinal data analysis using fixed-effects and random-effects models. I emphasize conceptual clarity and theoretical intuition, with mathematical rigor deferred to the appendix. The session also covers the key empirical decisions researchers face when working with panel data—when to use each model, how to interpret estimates, and the assumptions underlying them. This one-day workshop includes hands-on exercises in R and is taught in Spanish. Participants are expected to have prior experience with R and an intermediate understanding of linear regression.

## Organization

This repository contains the slides and supporting materials for the workshop:

- The **session/** folder contains the file *Escuela_Metodos_ELSOC__Efectos_Fijos_y_Efectos_Aleatorios_2025.pdf*, which is the slide deck for the session. It includes references and further readings to continue learning about the estimators discussed in this workshop.

- The **code/** folder contains the three R scripts used during the workshop:
  1. `Codigo_01__Ejemplos_de_Clases.R` — replicates the examples presented in the slides.  
  2. `Codigo_02__Ejercicios_Practicos.R` — contains the prompts and exercises used during the hands-on portion of the workshop.  
  3. `Codigo_03__Respuestas_a_Ejercicios.R` — provides the solutions to the exercises.

The workshop uses data from the **Chile Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC)**. You can access the dataset in the following [repository](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/elsoc). Specifically, the session uses the following files:

- `ELSOC_2016_2022__Long.dta`  
- `ELSOC_2016_2022__Wide.dta`
